# MSP Ansible Infrastructure Management Platform - Complete Overview

**Status**: Testing and validation platform; pilot-ready components.  
**Repository**: https://github.com/sethluby/msp-ansible-platform

## Platform Transformation

### **From Compliance Focus to Comprehensive Platform**
This project has evolved from its original "MSP CMMC Compliance automation" scope to become a comprehensive **MSP Ansible Infrastructure Management Platform** supporting multiple compliance frameworks and deployment architectures.

### **Key Evolution Points**
- **Original**: CMMC-specific compliance automation
- **Current**: Multi-framework compliance platform (DISA STIG, CMMC, CIS, SOC2, HIPAA)
- **Architecture**: Three optional deployment models for maximum client flexibility
- **Scope**: Complete MSP infrastructure management with 10 enterprise playbooks

## üéØ **Platform Highlights**

### **Implemented Playbooks**
1. **system-update.yml** - Multi-OS patch management with maintenance windows and LVM snapshots
2. **disa-stig-compliance.yml** - 10+ DISA security controls with client-specific exceptions
3. **cmmc-compliance.yml** - CMMC Level 2/3 automation across 8+ security domains
4. **user-management.yml** - Complete user lifecycle with client isolation and SSH key management
5. **firewall-management.yml** - Multi-distribution support (firewalld, ufw, iptables)
6. **security-hardening.yml** - CIS benchmarks with auto-detection and profile-based hardening
7. **monitoring-alerting.yml** - Prometheus + custom metrics with client-specific thresholds
8. **backup-recovery.yml** - Comprehensive data protection with encryption and verification
9. **service-management.yml** - Systemd service lifecycle with policy-based automation
10. **inventory-collection.yml** - Asset management with multiple output formats (JSON, YAML, CSV)

### **Infrastructure Deployment Automation**
- **deploy-msp-infrastructure.yml** - Complete MSP platform deployment with monitoring
- **deploy-client-infrastructure.yml** - Multi-architecture client deployment automation
- **Infrastructure roles** - Reusable components for all deployment scenarios
- **Bootstrap scripts** - Setup for each architecture

## üèóÔ∏è **Three Optional Client Deployment Architectures**

### **Client Choice Philosophy**
Unlike traditional MSP platforms that force a single connectivity model, our platform provides **three optional architectures** that clients can choose based on their specific requirements:

### **1. Pull-Based Architecture (Autonomous)**
- **Client Control**: Systems autonomously pull automation every 15 minutes
- **Network Requirements**: Outbound HTTPS only (port 443)
- **Security Model**: Client-controlled with MSP policy enforcement
- **Use Cases**: Air-gapped environments, high client autonomy preferences
- **Bootstrap**: `bootstrap/bootstrap-pull-based.sh`

**Features:**
- Systemd timer integration for reliable scheduling
- Multi-OS support (RHEL, Ubuntu, SUSE, Alpine)
- Local caching and graceful degradation
- Health monitoring and automated recovery

### **2. Bastion Host Architecture (Real-time)**
- **Connectivity**: Lightweight WireGuard VPN tunnels
- **Resources**: Alpine Linux bastions (512MB RAM, 8GB disk)
- **Security Model**: Network segmentation with encrypted tunnels
- **Use Cases**: Real-time monitoring, immediate incident response
- **Bootstrap**: `bootstrap/bootstrap-bastion-host.sh`

**Features:**
- WireGuard hub-and-spoke topology
- Certificate-based authentication
- Network isolation and firewall automation
- Real-time connectivity monitoring

### **3. Reverse Tunnel Architecture (Maximum Security)**
- **Connectivity**: SSH reverse tunnels through client firewalls
- **Security Model**: Zero inbound connections, certificate authentication
- **Network Requirements**: Outbound SSH only (port 22/2222)
- **Use Cases**: Highly regulated environments, maximum security compliance
- **Bootstrap**: `bootstrap/bootstrap-reverse-tunnel.sh`

**Features:**
- Autossh reliability with automatic reconnection
- Maximum security firewall (all inbound blocked)
- Complete audit trails and session recording
- MSP-controlled access with time-based restrictions

## üè¢ **Multi-Tenant Architecture**

### **Complete Client Isolation**
- **Data Isolation**: Client-specific directories, logs, and configuration files
- **Operational Isolation**: Session tracking with client identifiers
- **Variable Isolation**: Dedicated group_vars directories per client
- **Network Isolation**: Client-specific connectivity models and network segments

### **Centralized MSP Control**
- **Unified Logging**: Centralized syslog with client-tagged structured data
- **Cross-Client Reporting**: Aggregate operational metrics and compliance status
- **Shared Playbooks**: Common automation with client-specific customization
- **Global Policies**: MSP-wide defaults with client override capabilities

### **Session Tracking Example**
```bash
# Every operation includes client-specific session tracking
session_id: "1640995200-acme_corp-update"
client_name: "acme_corp"
operation_type: "system_update"
```
