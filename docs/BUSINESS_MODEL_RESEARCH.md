# Business Model Research (Archived)

This document captures historical, research-only notes originally present in the README. It is not a market statement, price list, or readiness claim. Use for context only.

## Example Service Tiers (No Pricing)
- Foundation: Basic monitoring, security hardening, patch management
- Professional: Compliance automation, custom workflows, expanded monitoring
- Enterprise: Advanced compliance frameworks (e.g., CMMC), dedicated support

## Considerations and Hypotheses

- 24/7 monitoring with automated remediation workflows
- Documentation-driven operations and handover packages

## Scope
- Intended for internal research and validation discussions
- Not maintained for accuracy; defer to repository tags, CI status, and CHANGELOG for current state
