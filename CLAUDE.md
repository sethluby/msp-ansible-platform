# MSP Ansible CMMC Compliance Management Project

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive Ansible-based infrastructure management solution for MSPs serving defense contractors requiring CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) compliance. The architecture provides automated compliance monitoring, security hardening, and centralized management across hundreds of client Linux environments.

## Documentation Standards
- **Always update CLAUDE.md** when making significant changes to the project
- **Maintain changelog** with dates, changes, and reasoning
- **Document all architectural decisions** and trade-offs
- **Keep README.md current** with setup instructions and project status
- **Version control everything** - this project is tracked in git at ssh://git@git.lan.sethluby.com:222/thndrchckn/cmmc-ansible.git
- **Automated backups** via ~/Documents/Scripts/git-backup.sh systemd timer

## Key Components

### Core Architecture
- **Hub-and-spoke design** with regional bastion hosts for secure access
- **Ansible Tower/AWX** for centralized automation orchestration
- **HashiCorp Vault** for secrets management and certificate authority
- **Zero-trust network architecture** with VPN connectivity and network segmentation
- **Multi-tenant isolation** ensuring complete client separation

### Security Framework
- **Certificate-based authentication** with automated rotation
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with client-specific permissions
- **Multi-factor authentication** for all administrative access
- **Comprehensive audit logging** meeting CMMC requirements
- **Encryption in transit and at rest** using industry-standard protocols

### CMMC Compliance Integration
- **Automated validation** of AC, AU, CM, IA, SC, and SI control families
- **Continuous monitoring** with real-time compliance reporting
- **Gap analysis and remediation** automation
- **Compliance dashboards** for client reporting and certification support

### Technical Implementation
- **Ansible playbooks** for security hardening (CIS benchmarks, SELinux/AppArmor)
- **Dynamic inventory** management with Vault integration
- **Performance optimization** for large-scale deployments (1000+ systems)
- **Disaster recovery** procedures with automated failover capabilities

## Business Context

### Market Opportunity
- **$300+ billion** in annual DoD contracts requiring CMMC certification by 2026
- **Severe shortage** of qualified CMMC implementation professionals
- **MSPs charging 30-50% premium** for CMMC-compliant services
- **First-mover advantage** in automated CMMC compliance market

### Pricing Strategy
- **Tiered service model**: Foundation ($95-125/server/month), Professional ($65-89/server/month), Enterprise ($42-59/server/month)
- **High-value add-ons**: Certification assistance, custom development, incident response
- **ROI proposition**: 50-70% cost reduction vs in-house compliance teams

## Technical Specifications

### Supported Environments
- **Operating Systems**: RHEL/CentOS 7-9, Ubuntu 18.04-22.04, SLES 12-15
- **Scale**: 10-500+ Linux systems per client
- **Network**: IPSec/WireGuard VPN, network segmentation, firewall automation
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana stack with ELK logging infrastructure

### Key Automation Areas
- **Security hardening**: SSH configuration, firewall rules, user management
- **Patch management**: Automated security updates with staged rollouts
- **Compliance validation**: Real-time CMMC control verification
- **Incident response**: Automated containment and forensic data collection

## Project Goals
- **Scalable automation** platform serving 100+ defense contractor clients
- **99.9% compliance** success rate for CMMC Level 2/3 certifications
- **Reduced operational overhead** through comprehensive automation
- **Competitive differentiation** in MSP market through specialized CMMC expertise

## Career Development Context
This project represents a unique opportunity to build expertise at the intersection of:
- **Linux systems administration** at enterprise scale
- **Cybersecurity compliance** frameworks and automation
- **Infrastructure as Code** and configuration management
- **Defense industry** requirements and business processes

The role involves architecting solutions from the ground up, making it ideal for building a portfolio of innovative automation frameworks and establishing thought leadership in the CMMC automation space.
