# MSP Ansible Infrastructure Management Platform

A comprehensive Ansible-based infrastructure management solution for Managed Service Providers. Provides centralized automation with secure client connectivity and flexible compliance framework support.

## ⚠️ Important Notice: Testing and Validation Platform

**This is a comprehensive testing and validation platform, not a production-ready solution.** This project provides:
- Complete testing frameworks for MSP automation concepts
- Comprehensive validation tools for compliance and security automation
- Pilot testing infrastructure for controlled MSP partner evaluation
- Research framework for business model validation

**For Production Use**: Extensive testing, security auditing, and compliance validation would be required before any production deployment. This platform is designed for research, testing, and pilot program evaluation.

## Quick Start

### Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/sethluby/msp-ansible-platform.git
cd msp-ansible-platform

# Initial setup
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
- **Maximum Modularity** - Docker-based services for easy deployment/removal
- **Graceful Disconnection** - Clients can operate independently after MSP departure
- **Minimal Infrastructure** - Lightweight bastion hosts (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
- **Compliance Ready** - Modular framework supporting multiple compliance standards

### Essential Services Stack
```yaml
# MSP infrastructure deployment
services:
  ansible-awx:     # Automation orchestration
  vault:           # Secrets management  
  redis:           # AWX dependency
  postgres:        # AWX database
```

## Business Model Research Framework

### Example Service Tiers (Research Purposes Only)
**Important Disclaimer**: *The following pricing examples are for research and testing framework purposes only. Each MSP would establish their own pricing based on their specific market, operational costs, and value proposition.*

- **Foundation (example: $35-50/server/month)**: Basic monitoring, security hardening, patch management
- **Professional (example: $65-89/server/month)**: Advanced compliance, custom automation, 24/7 monitoring
- **Enterprise (example: $95-125/server/month)**: Premium compliance frameworks including CMMC, dedicated support

### Value Proposition Research
**Note**: *The following are theoretical calculations for research and validation purposes only.*
- **Theoretical cost reduction**: 50-70% vs in-house compliance teams (subject to validation)
- **Target compliance success**: 99.9% success rate through automated validation
- **No vendor lock-in**: Clients retain full automation capabilities through graceful disconnection
- **Monitoring capabilities**: 24/7 automated response workflow testing

   - Maximum client control and autonomy
   - Minimal network requirements (HTTPS only)
   - Air-gap compatible with periodic sync
   - Bootstrap: `bootstrap/bootstrap-pull-based.sh`

2. **Bastion Host Architecture** - Lightweight WireGuard VPN connectivity
   - Real-time monitoring and immediate response
   - Alpine Linux bastion hosts (512MB RAM)
   - Secure VPN tunnels with network segmentation
   - Bootstrap: `bootstrap/bootstrap-bastion-host.sh`

3. **Reverse Tunnel Architecture** - Maximum security SSH reverse tunnels
   - Zero inbound connections to client networks
   - Certificate-based authentication and audit trails
   - Highest security for regulated environments
   - Bootstrap: `bootstrap/bootstrap-reverse-tunnel.sh`
