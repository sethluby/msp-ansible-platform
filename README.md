# MSP Ansible Infrastructure Management Platform

A comprehensive Ansible-based infrastructure management solution for Managed Service Providers. Provides centralized automation with secure client connectivity and flexible compliance framework support.

## Quick Start

### Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/sethluby/msp-ansible-platform.git
cd msp-ansible-platform

# Initial setup
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
- **Maximum Modularity** - Docker-based services for easy deployment/removal
- **Graceful Disconnection** - Clients can operate independently after MSP departure
- **Minimal Infrastructure** - Lightweight bastion hosts (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
- **Compliance Ready** - Modular framework supporting multiple compliance standards

### Essential Services Stack
```yaml
# MSP infrastructure deployment
services:
  ansible-awx:     # Automation orchestration
  vault:           # Secrets management  
  redis:           # AWX dependency
  postgres:        # AWX database
```

## Business Model

### Service Tiers
- **Foundation**: $35-50/server/month (Basic monitoring, security hardening)
- **Professional**: $65-89/server/month (Advanced compliance, custom automation)  
- **Enterprise**: $95-125/server/month (Premium compliance frameworks including CMMC, dedicated support)

### Value Proposition
- **50-70% cost reduction** vs in-house compliance teams
- **99.9% compliance** success rate target
- **No vendor lock-in** - clients retain full automation capabilities
- **24/7 monitoring** with automated remediation
