# MSP Ansible Infrastructure Management Platform

A comprehensive Ansible-based infrastructure management solution for Managed Service Providers. Provides centralized automation with secure client connectivity and flexible compliance framework support.

## Quick Start

### Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/sethluby/msp-ansible-platform.git
cd msp-ansible-platform

# Initial setup
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
- **Maximum Modularity** - Docker-based services for easy deployment/removal
- **Graceful Disconnection** - Clients can operate independently after MSP departure
- **Minimal Infrastructure** - Lightweight bastion hosts (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
- **Compliance Ready** - Modular framework supporting multiple compliance standards

### Essential Services Stack
```yaml
# MSP infrastructure deployment
services:
  ansible-awx:     # Automation orchestration
  vault:           # Secrets management  
  redis:           # AWX dependency
  postgres:        # AWX database
```

## Business Model

### Service Tiers
- **Foundation**: $35-50/server/month (Basic monitoring, security hardening)
- **Professional**: $65-89/server/month (Advanced compliance, custom automation)  
- **Enterprise**: $95-125/server/month (Premium compliance frameworks including CMMC, dedicated support)

### Value Proposition
- **50-70% cost reduction** vs in-house compliance teams
- **99.9% compliance** success rate target
- **No vendor lock-in** - clients retain full automation capabilities
- **24/7 monitoring** with automated remediation

## Current Status

**Phase**: Core Platform Complete (85%)  
**Version**: 1.0.0-beta  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-28

### âœ… **Production Complete - 10 Enterprise Playbooks**
- **system-update.yml** - Multi-OS patch management (RHEL, Ubuntu, SUSE) with maintenance windows
- **disa-stig-compliance.yml** - 10+ DISA security controls with client exceptions
- **cmmc-compliance.yml** - CMMC Level 2/3 automation across 8+ security domains
- **user-management.yml** - Complete lifecycle (create, modify, remove, audit) with client isolation
- **firewall-management.yml** - Multi-distribution support (firewalld, ufw, iptables)
- **security-hardening.yml** - CIS benchmarks with auto-detection and profile-based hardening
- **monitoring-alerting.yml** - Prometheus + custom metrics with client-specific thresholds
- **backup-recovery.yml** - Comprehensive data protection with encryption and verification
- **service-management.yml** - Systemd service lifecycle with policy-based automation
- **inventory-collection.yml** - Asset management with multiple output formats

### âœ… **Enterprise Architecture Complete**
- **Multi-tenant isolation** - Client-specific variables, logging, and session tracking
- **MSP operational excellence** - Centralized logging, rollback capabilities, error handling
- **Security compliance** - DISA STIG, CMMC Level 2/3, CIS benchmarks automated
- **Production hardening** - Maintenance windows, verification, audit trails
- **Comprehensive documentation** - 50+ page playbook reference, operational guides

### âœ… **Infrastructure Deployment Complete**
- **deploy-msp-infrastructure.yml** - Complete MSP platform deployment with monitoring stack
- **deploy-client-infrastructure.yml** - Multi-architecture client deployment automation
- **Bootstrap scripts** - Production-ready setup for all three deployment architectures
- **Infrastructure roles** - Reusable components for MSP and client infrastructure
- **Three deployment architectures** - Client choice between pull-based, bastion host, or reverse tunnel

### ðŸš€ **Three Optional Client Deployment Architectures**
1. **Pull-Based Architecture** - Client systems autonomously pull automation every 15 minutes
   - Maximum client control and autonomy
   - Minimal network requirements (HTTPS only)
   - Air-gap compatible with periodic sync
   - Bootstrap: `bootstrap/bootstrap-pull-based.sh`

2. **Bastion Host Architecture** - Lightweight WireGuard VPN connectivity
   - Real-time monitoring and immediate response
   - Alpine Linux bastion hosts (512MB RAM)
   - Secure VPN tunnels with network segmentation
   - Bootstrap: `bootstrap/bootstrap-bastion-host.sh`

3. **Reverse Tunnel Architecture** - Maximum security SSH reverse tunnels
   - Zero inbound connections to client networks
   - Certificate-based authentication and audit trails
   - Highest security for regulated environments
   - Bootstrap: `bootstrap/bootstrap-reverse-tunnel.sh`

**Key Innovation**: Clients can choose ANY combination of these architectures based on their specific security, network, and operational requirements.
